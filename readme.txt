== general information ==
The idea behind this plugin was to implement an interactive real-life geocache-quiz. Different QR-Codes are spread out in a city and players can search them.
After scanning the QR-Codes, a question is displayed and the page-accesses, e.g. the number of questions answered, are counted. After a pre-defined number of questions, a part of 
a "secret" message is printed.  

This plugin tracks the number of page-accesses and prints a secret word step-by-step. Opening a page multiple times does only count as one access.
The accesses are only counted, if the site is from the custom-post-type question. Also, with the custom-post-type regions, each question can be linked
to a specific region and each region has its own cookie to count the number of accesses. The secret word can also be set in the custom-post-type region for every region.
Also, the "modulo", e.g. the number of page-accesses until a part of the secret word is printed, can be set there.

As cookies are essential for the working-mechanism of the website, the cookie should be a necessary cookie. The cookie will remain valid for 1 day.

== shortcode ==
This shortcode can be used to display the secret word if enough page accesses are reached
